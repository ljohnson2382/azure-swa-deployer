"# This workflow is intentionally DISABLED to prevent any Azure deployments from
# running from this repository.
#
# To re-enable: restore the original workflow from
# `.github/workflows/deploy-infra.yml.disabled` (created alongside this file)
# and remove these comment lines. Keep secrets and credentials out of this
# repository; use a separate deploy repo with strict controls for production.
#
# The original workflow contents are preserved in
# `.github/workflows/deploy-infra.yml.disabled` for reference.
#
# DO NOT add any `on:` triggers or `jobs:` here unless you intend to
# re-enable deployments.

# Disabled placeholder - no executable workflow content
